 * This file contains the recipe to build a deployment archive by via a composer.json file.
 * To do so, create a build.php file in the same directory where your builds and
 * base-config directories are located. Additional in the same directory you need a composer.json file, the
 * composer.phar file and, if you need to access protected git repositiories, also a auth.json with the access data.
 * To create the archive run the following command in the console from the PowerUI exface directory:
 *
 * vendor\bin\dep -f={filepath} ComposerInstall
 *
 * The {filepath} variable is the path to the build.php file
 *
 * Structure for build.php:
