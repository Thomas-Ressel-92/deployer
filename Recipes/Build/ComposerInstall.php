 * This file contains the recipe to build a deployment archive by via a composer.json file.
 * To do so, create a build.php file in the same directory where your builds directories are located. Additional in the same directory you need a composer.json file, the
 * composer.phar file and, if you need to access protected git repositiories, also a auth.json with the access data.
 * To create the archive run the following command in the console from the PowerUI exface directory:
 *
 * vendor\bin\dep -f={filepath} ComposerInstall
 *
 * The {filepath} variable is the path to the build.php file
 *
 * Structure for build.php:
 
 <?php

 //name for the release/archive
 $releaseName = 'ahsfgkuasfashfafs';
 set('release_name', $releaseName);
 
 //name can be generatet instead of set, then this option is needed
 //name will be generated by appending a DateTime stamp to the given string
 //in this option
 //if release_name is set, this option will be ignored
 set('customer_specific_version', '0.28.7-beta');
 
 // === Path definitions ===
 //path to builds directory
